# ResQChain README

**ResQChain** is a Clarity smart contract designed to enhance natural disaster response by managing relief efforts, tracking resources, and coordinating volunteers efficiently. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system ensures transparency, accountability, and effective distribution of aid during disasters.

## Project Overview

`ResQChain` offers a decentralized approach to natural disaster response, facilitating better communication and resource management among NGOs, government agencies, and affected communities.

### Key Features:
- **Disaster Relief Management:** Tracks ongoing disaster events and manages the lifecycle of each incident.
- **Resource Tracking:** Monitors inventory levels, allocation, and needs of essential supplies like food, water, and medical equipment.
- **Volunteer Coordination:** Registers and manages volunteers with systematized verification and reputation scoring.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Clarity](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/developer-tools/clarity/overview) development environment
- [Stacks Blockchain API](https://docs.hiro.so/api)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourgithub/resqchain.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd resqchain
   ```

### Running the Contract
Deploy the contract on your local testnet or on the Stacks mainnet using the appropriate Clarity tools.

## Usage

### Contract Constants
Several constants are defined to handle errors and validate data:

```clarity
(define-constant err-owner-only (err u100))
(define-constant err-invalid-amount (err u101))
...
```

### Smart Contract Functions
#### Public Functions
- `add-resources`: Adds resources to the inventory for a specified disaster.
- `request-resources`: Requests allocation of resources to a specified area or group.
- `post-disaster-update`: Posts updates about disaster status, needs, or other critical information.

#### Read-Only Functions
- `get-resource-inventory`: Retrieves the current state of resources for a specific disaster.
- `get-volunteer-info`: Provides information about registered volunteers.

## Use Case Scenario

### Scenario: Hurricane Relief Operation

**Context:** A hurricane has struck the coastal region of Country X. The local government and international aid organizations are mobilizing to assist affected communities.

**Steps:**
1. **Disaster Registration:** The system registers the hurricane as an active disaster, detailing its severity and affected locations.
2. **Resource Mobilization:** As donations and supplies come in, `add-resources` is called to log these in the system.
3. **Volunteer Coordination:** Volunteers register through the contract, and their skills and availability are logged using `volunteers`.
4. **Resource Allocation:** Affected areas request resources as needs are assessed. The `request-resources` function is used to allocate supplies efficiently.
5. **Updates and Communication:** Regular updates are posted through `post-disaster-update` to keep all parties informed of the status and evolving needs.

This scenario demonstrates how `ResQChain` facilitates a coordinated response to natural disasters, ensuring timely and effective aid distribution.
